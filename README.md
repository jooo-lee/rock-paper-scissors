# Rock Paper Scissors!

My implementation of the Rock Paper Scissors game for The Odin Project. You can play [here](https://jooo-lee.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/)!

## Description:

The player plays against the computer, with the winner being the first one to 5 wins.

I first built a version of the game which was played in the browser console and then later on I added a UI so that the game could be played in the browser.

## I learned how to:

* Randomly select an element from an array
* Add and remove event listeners 
* Play audio
* Trigger CSS transitions using Javascript
* Make the web page mobile friendly
* Wrap elements when the window is resized
* Dynamically manipulate the DOM
